# Build in Public - Day 1: Launching æ˜¾åŒ–369

ðŸš€ **Starting my 100-day product challenge with æ˜¾åŒ–369 - a manifestation app based on Tesla's 369 method!**

## What is æ˜¾åŒ–369?
A systematic approach to manifestation combining:
- Tesla's 369 theory
- Modern psychology research  
- Daily practice tracking
- Community support

## Why Build in Public?
As a developer with 10+ years experience, I believe in transparency. Every line of code, every user feedback, every pivot - I'm sharing it all.

**Current Status:**
- âœ… MVP launched on Supabase + React
- âœ… 500+ users signed up in beta
- âœ… Core 369 practice features working
- ðŸ”„ Adding gamification elements

## The Method
Based on Nikola Tesla's obsession with 3, 6, 9:
- Morning: Write your wish 3 times
- Afternoon: Write it 6 times  
- Evening: Write it 9 times
- Track progress & celebrate wins

## Tech Stack
- React + TypeScript
- Supabase (auth + database)
- Tailwind CSS
- PWA enabled

## Day 1 Goals
- [ ] Ship user onboarding improvements
- [ ] Add social sharing feature
- [ ] Respond to all user feedback
- [ ] Plan week 1 features
