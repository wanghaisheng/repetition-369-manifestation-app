**Title:** [Day 1/100] Building a manifestation app that helps people achieve their dreams using the 369 method - here's my complete build in public plan

Hey Reddit! 👋

I'm starting a 100-day build in public journey creating a manifestation app based on the 369 method, and I want to share everything with this amazing community.

## What is the 369 Method? 🤔

The 369 manifestation technique, inspired by Nikola Tesla's obsession with the numbers 3, 6, and 9, involves writing your desires:
- **3 times** in the morning (setting intention)
- **6 times** in the afternoon (reinforcing belief)  
- **9 times** at night (releasing to universe)

Tesla believed these numbers held the key to the universe. Whether you believe in manifestation or just want to clarify your goals through repetitive writing, the method has helped thousands worldwide.

## The Problem I'm Solving 💡

After researching the market, I found:
- No dedicated app exists for the 369 method specifically
- Existing manifestation apps are either too complex or too simple
- People lose track of their writing sessions across different times of day
- No proper progress tracking or habit formation features
- Most solutions are just basic note-taking apps

## My Solution: 369 Manifestation App ✨

**Core Features:**
- Structured 3-6-9 writing sessions with guided prompts
- Smart reminder system for optimal timing
- Progress tracking and streak counters
- Offline-first PWA (works without internet)
- Beautiful, mindful writing interface
- Privacy-first (your wishes stay private)
- Gamification to build consistent habits

**Tech Stack:**
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase (PostgreSQL + Edge Functions)
- Architecture: PWA with offline capabilities
- Deployment: Vercel with global CDN

## Current Status (Day 1) 📊

✅ **Completed:**
- User authentication and profiles
- Wish creation and management system
- Practice session tracking
- Basic analytics dashboard
- Responsive mobile-first design
- PWA setup with offline support

🔄 **In Progress:**
- Gamification system (badges, streaks, levels)
- Advanced reminder algorithms
- Social sharing features (optional)
- A/B testing different UI approaches

📋 **Roadmap:**
- Week 1-2: Core functionality polish
- Week 3-4: Gamification and engagement features
- Week 5-8: User acquisition and feedback integration
- Week 9-12: Monetization and scaling

## My 100-Day Goals 🎯

**User Metrics:**
- 1,000 registered users
- 500 weekly active users
- 10,000 manifestation sessions logged
- 70%+ retention rate after 30 days

**Product Metrics:**
- 4.8+ star rating on app stores
- Sub-3 second load times
- 99.9% uptime
- Mobile-first experience

**Business Metrics:**
- $1,000 Monthly Recurring Revenue
- 50+ user testimonials
- Featured on Product Hunt
- Sustainable unit economics

## What I'm Sharing Daily 📝

I'll be completely transparent about:
- **Code & Development:** Technical challenges, solutions, architecture decisions
- **User Feedback:** Real user testimonials, feature requests, pain points
- **Metrics:** Daily active users, retention rates, conversion funnels
- **Revenue:** Pricing experiments, monetization attempts, actual numbers
- **Failures:** What doesn't work, bugs, user churn reasons
- **Learnings:** Insights about manifestation, user behavior, product-market fit

## Day 1 Technical Deep-Dive 🔧

**Database Schema:**
```sql
- Users (auth handled by Supabase)
- Wishes (user goals with categories)
- Practice_Sessions (3-6-9 tracking)
- Achievements (gamification)
```

**Key Technical Decisions:**
1. **Supabase over Firebase:** Better PostgreSQL support, edge functions
2. **PWA over Native:** Faster iteration, easier distribution
3. **Tailwind over styled-components:** Faster prototyping, smaller bundle
4. **Row-level security:** Users can only access their own data

**Biggest Challenge So Far:**
Implementing the writing interface that feels meditative and focused while being technically robust for offline use. Solved using IndexedDB with background sync.

## Community Engagement Plan 📱

**Daily Updates:**
- Twitter: Daily metrics and feature updates
- Reddit: Weekly deep-dives and milestone posts  
- LinkedIn: Professional insights and business learnings
- Product Hunt: Building anticipation for launch

**User Research:**
- Weekly user interviews (5 users minimum)
- Feature voting in Discord community
- A/B testing different approaches
- Behavioral analytics (privacy-compliant)

## How You Can Help 🤝

1. **Feedback:** What features would make you use a manifestation app?
2. **Testing:** Beta testers welcome (DM me)
3. **Sharing:** If this resonates, please share with friends
4. **Questions:** Ask anything about manifestation, development, or business

## Questions for the Community ❓

1. Have you tried manifestation techniques before? What worked/didn't work?
2. What would make you pay $5/month for a manifestation app?
3. How important is privacy vs. community features in this space?
4. Would you prefer a simple app or one with advanced tracking?

## Day 1 Metrics 📈
