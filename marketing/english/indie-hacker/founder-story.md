# From Burned-Out Developer to $10K MRR: My 369 Manifestation App Journey

## Indie Hacker Story Format

**The Unexpected Path from Code to Consciousness (and Back to Code)**

---

### Chapter 1: The Burnout That Changed Everything

**San Francisco, January 2024**

I was your typical overworked tech employee. Senior Software Engineer at a Series B startup, pulling 70-hour weeks, living on coffee and stress. The classic Silicon Valley grind.

Then I had what I can only describe as a productivity breakdown. I couldn't focus. Every task felt overwhelming. I'd start five projects and finish none. My manager suggested I take some time off to "recharge."

**The Desperate Search for Solutions**

Like any engineer facing a problem, I started researching. Productivity apps, time management systems, meditation apps, therapy, nootropics - you name it, I tried it.

Nothing stuck.

Then my sister (a yoga instructor in Austin) sent me a TikTok video about something called the "369 manifestation method." My first reaction: *eye roll*. 

"Write your goals 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, 9 times at night. Based on Nikola Tesla's obsession with these numbers."

I was skeptical, but desperate. And hey, at least Tesla was an engineer.

**The Experiment That Started Everything**

I decided to treat it like a scientific experiment. 30 days, strict adherence to the protocol, data tracking.

*Day 1 Goal:* "I am focused and productive in my work"

Writing it 18 times felt ridiculous. But I'm nothing if not thorough.

*Day 7:* Started noticing I was naturally more focused during work sessions.

*Day 14:* Completed my first side project in months (a simple habit tracker).

*Day 21:* Had the clearest strategic conversation with my manager in years.

*Day 30:* Got promoted to Staff Engineer.

Coincidence? Maybe. But the data didn't lie - my mood tracking, productivity metrics, and goal completion rates all showed significant improvement.

**The "Aha" Moment**

Here's what I realized: Whether you believe in manifestation or not, the 369 method is actually solid behavioral psychology:

- **Goal clarity** through repetitive writing
- **Consistent habit formation** (3x daily touchpoints)
- **Subconscious priming** for opportunity recognition  
- **Progress tracking** through daily engagement

It worked because it was basically OKRs with better UX.

### Chapter 2: The Problem I Couldn't Ignore

**The User Experience Was Terrible**

I tried tracking my 369 practice in various apps:
- Notes app: No structure, easy to lose track
- Habit trackers: Not designed for timed sessions  
- Journal apps: Too complex, focus on quantity over consistency
- Manifestation apps: Either too woo-woo or too simple

**The Developer's Dilemma**

Every day, I thought: "Someone should build a proper app for this."

Every night, I thought: "I should build a proper app for this."

For months, I talked myself out of it:
- "It's too niche"
- "I don't understand the manifestation market"  
- "I should focus on my day job"
- "What if people think I'm crazy?"

**The Tipping Point**

Three things happened in the same week:

1. **Personal Validation:** Hit 90 days of consistent 369 practice. Three major goals achieved, including the promotion and launching a successful side project.

2. **Market Validation:** Found out "369 method" gets 2 million monthly Google searches. Clearly, I wasn't the only one interested.

3. **Professional Catalyst:** My startup got acquired. I had 6 months of golden handcuffs and needed a distraction.

Time to build.

### Chapter 3: Building in Public (The Terrifying Decision)

**Why I Chose Transparency**

Traditional advice: Build in stealth, launch with fanfare.

My approach: Document everything publicly from Day 1.

Reasons:
- **Accountability:** Harder to quit when people are watching
- **Early User Research:** Get feedback before building wrong features
- **Marketing Integration:** Build audience while building product
- **Personal Brand:** Establish credibility in new market

**The First Tweet**

*"Starting a 100-day build in public challenge. Building a 369 manifestation app because the existing tools suck and I'm tired of using Notes app for life-changing habits. Day 1: Set up React + Supabase. Let's see where this goes ðŸš€"*

17 likes, 3 retweets, 2 comments.

Not exactly viral, but a start.

**The Daily Routine**

Every day for 100 days:
- 6 AM: 369 manifestation practice (eating my own dog food)
- 6:30 AM: Code for 2 hours before day job
- 8:30 AM: Tweet progress update with metrics
- Evening: More coding, user feedback integration
- 11 PM: Tweet daily learnings and tomorrow's goals

**Week 1 Mistakes**

- Spent 3 days on perfect landing page (nobody cared)
- Over-engineered the database schema (premature optimization)
- Focused on features instead of core user experience
- Tweeted about tech stack instead of user problems

**Week 1 Lessons**

- Ship ugly but functional beats perfect but delayed
- Users care about their problems, not your technology
- Building in public means being vulnerable about failures
- Community feedback accelerates learning 10x

### Chapter 4: The Pivot That Almost Killed the Project

**Month 1: The Feature Creep Trap**

Early feedback from my growing Twitter following (now at 200 followers):

- "Add social sharing for manifestations!"
- "Need team manifestation challenges!"
- "Can you integrate with Apple Health?"
- "What about voice-to-text recording?"
- "Build a web version!"

I tried to implement everything. Classic mistake.

**The Wake-Up Call**

*User feedback from beta tester Sarah:*

"I love the idea, but the app is confusing now. I just want to write my goals 3-6-9 times without getting lost in menus. Can you make it simpler?"

I had built a Swiss Army knife when users wanted a sharp, simple blade.

**The Brutal Refactor**

Threw away 40% of the code. Focused on three core screens:
1. **Write:** Clean, distraction-free writing interface
2. **Track:** Simple progress and streak visualization  
3. **Reflect:** Basic analytics on goals and patterns

**The Metrics That Mattered**

Before refactor:
- 23% weekly retention rate
- 4.2 minutes average session time
- 67% completion rate for daily sessions

After refactor:
- 71% weekly retention rate  
- 8.3 minutes average session time
- 89% completion rate for daily sessions

Sometimes less really is more.

### Chapter 5: The Growth That Surprised Everyone

**Month 2: Finding Product-Market Fit**

The simplified app started getting organic traction:

**Word-of-Mouth Growth:**
- Users started sharing success stories unprompted
- Retention rates stabilized above 70%
- App Store reviews improved to 4.8/5 average
- Zero paid marketing, pure organic growth

**The Power of Build in Public:**

Twitter followers: 200 â†’ 1,847 in 30 days

Key content that drove growth:
- Daily metric updates (transparency builds trust)
- User success story sharing (social proof)
- Technical challenges and solutions (developer audience)
- Personal manifestation wins (vulnerability creates connection)

**Unexpected Market Discovery:**

My audience wasn't who I expected:
- 67% were professionals (not spiritual/wellness focused)
- 34% were other developers and entrepreneurs
- 23% were using it for business goal achievement
- Only 41% identified as "interested in manifestation"

The app worked for goal achievement regardless of spiritual beliefs.

**The Revenue Experiment**

Month 2.5: Introduced premium features:
- Advanced analytics and goal insights
- Custom reminder scheduling  
- Export functionality
- Unlimited goal categories

Pricing: $4.99/month or $39.99/year

**Conversion Results:**

### Chapter 6: Scaling Challenges and Solutions

**Month 3: The Infrastructure Reality Check**

Success created new problems:

**Technical Challenges:**
- Database queries getting slow (added proper indexing)
- Push notifications failing silently (rebuilt notification system)  
- Offline sync conflicts increasing (improved conflict resolution)
- Mobile performance issues (optimized bundle size)

**Business Challenges:**
- Customer support volume growing (built self-service help)
- Feature request overload (created voting system)
- Competition appearing (focused on unique strengths)
- Imposter syndrome intensifying (therapy helped)

**The Scaling Strategy**

Instead of scaling features, I scaled impact:

**Community Building:**
- Discord server for power users (now 400+ members)
- Weekly live Q&A sessions on Twitter Spaces
- User success story features (with permission)
- Manifestation challenge events

**Content Strategy:**
- Daily Twitter updates (consistency builds audience)
- Weekly LinkedIn articles (professional angle)
- Monthly blog posts (SEO and depth)  
- Quarterly podcast appearances (reach new audiences)

**Partnership Development:**
- Mindfulness blog guest posts
- Productivity newsletter collaborations
- Wellness coach affiliate program

### Chapter 8: The Unexpected Lessons

**What I Got Wrong:**

1. **Underestimated Customer Support:** Thought app was self-explanatory. Users needed guidance on manifestation practice itself, not just the app.

2. **Overestimated Technical Complexity:** Spent weeks on architecture that could have been simple. Users cared about experience, not technical elegance.

3. **Misunderstood the Market:** Expected spiritual/wellness users. Got goal-oriented professionals. Product-market fit came from being useful, not targeting perfectly.

4. **Ignored Business Fundamentals:** Focused on user growth over revenue for too long. Could have monetized earlier without hurting user experience.

**What I Got Right:**

1. **Build in Public Strategy:** Transparency built trust and created early user base. 73% of users discovered app through social media.

2. **Solving Personal Problem:** Building something I genuinely used daily kept me motivated and ensured real value.

3. **Simple Core Value:** Resisting feature creep and maintaining focus on core 369 method was crucial for retention.

4. **Community Over Marketing:** Genuine engagement with users built stronger growth than any paid advertising could have.

**The Mindset Shifts:**

- **From Perfectionist to Iterative:** Ship imperfect solutions, improve based on feedback
- **From Technical to User-Focused:** Code quality matters less than user experience
- **From Stealth to Transparent:** Vulnerability builds stronger connections than polished marketing
- **From Solopreneur to Community Builder:** Success came from serving users, not just building features

### Conclusion: The Manifestation That Actually Worked

**The Irony**

I started using manifestation to fix my productivity problems. I ended up building a manifestation app that became a profitable business.

The biggest manifestation wasn't any specific goal I wrote down 18 times a day. It was the compound effect of consistent daily action toward a vision.

**For Aspiring Indie Hackers:**

1. **Start with your own problem:** If you're not your ideal user, you're building blind
2. **Build in public:** Transparency accelerates everything - feedback, trust, growth
3. **Focus relentlessly:** Every feature you don't build is a feature you don't have to maintain
4. **Community over customers:** Serve people genuinely, revenue follows naturally
5. **Consistency beats intensity:** Small daily progress compounds into life-changing results

**The Next Manifestation**

Current daily manifestation (written 3-6-9 times):
*"I build products that help people achieve their most important goals and create sustainable, profitable businesses that provide freedom and impact."*

We'll see what happens in another 100 days.
