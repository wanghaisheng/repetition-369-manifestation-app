    "q1": {
      "question": "What is the 369 Manifestation Method?",
      "answer": "The 369 Manifestation Method is based on Nikola Tesla's belief in the power of numbers 3, 6, and 9. Tesla said: \"If you only knew the magnificence of 3, 6, and 9, you would have the key to the universe.\" The practice involves writing your affirmation 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, and 9 times at night for 33-45 days. This structured repetition is based on neuroplasticity principles, helping rewire brain neural pathways and focus attention on your desired goals."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Is the 369 Method scientifically proven?",
      "answer": "Yes, while Tesla's number philosophy is the inspiration, the 369 method's effectiveness has three scientific foundations: 1) Neuroplasticity — repetitive writing rewires brain neural pathways; 2) Positive Psychology — positive affirmations boost self-efficacy; 3) Mindfulness — focused practice reduces anxiety and strengthens intention. We clearly state: this is a psychological training tool, not magic or mystical power."

    "q3": {
      "question": "How does the Manifestation 369 app help me practice?",
      "answer": "Manifestation 369 is a manifestation practice app by HeyManifestation. We provide: smart reminder system (ensuring 3-6-9 time slot practice), wish management, progress tracking, gamification (points, levels, badges), and community support. The app supports both Chinese and English, making manifestation practice simple, systematic, and trackable."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How long does it take to see results?",
      "answer": "According to neuroplasticity research, the optimal duration for forming new neural pathways is 33-45 days. Most users begin noticing shifts in thought patterns within 2-3 weeks. It's important to understand: writing is a tool for focusing intention, and success requires consistent practice + practical action. Results vary by individual, depending on practice consistency and personal commitment. We provide tools and methods, not guaranteed results."
    },
    "q5": {
      "question": "Is my data secure?",
      "answer": "Yes, we take data security very seriously. All data is encrypted, your personal wishes are completely private, and we follow international privacy laws like GDPR. Your manifestation content is only visible to you, and we never share your personal information with third parties."
    },
    "q6": {
      "question": "How do I write effective affirmations?",
      "answer": "Effective affirmations should: 1) Use present tense ('I have...' not 'I want...'); 2) Be specific and clear (avoid vague language); 3) Stay positive (focus on what you want, not what you don't want); 4) Include emotion (express how you'll feel when your desire manifests); 5) Align with your core values. Remember: consistency matters more than precise timing."

    "title": "Common Misconceptions",
    "subtitle": "We clearly address common misunderstandings about the 369 method",
    "q1": {
      "question": "Is the 369 method superstition?",
      "answer": "No. While we draw inspiration from Tesla's philosophy about 369 numbers, the method itself is a modern interpretation based on neuroscience and positive psychology principles. We never claim this is magic or mystical power — it's a psychological training tool."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Can I manifest just by writing?",
      "answer": "No. Writing is a tool for focusing intention, but it must be combined with practical action. Success requires consistent practice + real action. We provide tools and methods to help you stay focused and motivated, but achieving your goals still requires you to take concrete steps."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Do I have to write at exact times?",
      "answer": "No need to be strict about exact times. The morning/afternoon/evening time slots are designed to integrate practice into your daily rhythm, but consistency matters more than precise timing. The key is completing your 3-6-9 practice daily, not stressing about the exact minute."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "Can the 369 method replace therapy?",
      "answer": "No. Manifestation 369 is a positive mindset cultivation tool and cannot replace professional psychological therapy or medical advice. If you have serious mental health concerns, please seek professional help. Our app is a supplementary tool to help develop positive thinking habits."
