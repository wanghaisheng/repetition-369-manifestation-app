  "story": {
    "title": "Founder Story",
    "intro": "It all started with a simple question: Why is manifestation practice so hard to maintain?",
    "personal": "I'm 38 years old, and for most of my life, I've had a habit of self-blame that started in my childhood. Every mistake, every setback, I would automatically turn inward with harsh criticism. This mindset held me back in countless ways and created patterns of negative thinking that were difficult to break.",
    "turning": "Three years ago, I reached a breaking point. I knew I needed to change my mindset fundamentally if I was ever going to achieve the life I wanted. I began researching mindset shifts and discovered manifestation techniques. At first, I was skeptical – the idea that changing your thoughts could change your reality seemed too simple. But I was desperate for change, so I decided to try.",
    "problem": "The problem was that there wasn't much practical, easy-to-follow guidance available. Most resources were either too vague or overly complicated. I found myself piecing together information from various sources, trying different methods through trial and error.",
    "solution": "This frustration became my inspiration. I realized I couldn't be the only person struggling to find practical manifestation resources. So I decided to create HeyManifestation – a platform dedicated to making manifestation techniques accessible, practical, and backed by science.",
    "discovery": "As I explored different manifestation techniques, I discovered the power of the 369 method – inspired by Nikola Tesla's belief in the special properties of these numbers. The structured approach of writing affirmations 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, and 9 times at night created a powerful rhythm that seemed to amplify intentions.",
    "creation": "But I also discovered a problem: there weren't any good tools to support this practice. Consistency is key in manifestation work, but it's easy to forget, especially when you're just starting. That's why I created 'Manifestation 369' – to provide a tool specifically designed to support the 369 method: reminders, affirmation creation guidance, progress tracking, and a community of like-minded practitioners."

  "method": {
    "title": "The Science Behind the 369 Method",
    "origin": "The 369 method is inspired by Nikola Tesla's belief in the numbers 3, 6, and 9. Tesla once said: 'If you only knew the magnificence of the 3, 6, and 9, then you would have a key to the universe.'",
    "science": "While the mystical properties of the numbers themselves lack scientific verification, the effectiveness of the 369 method has a solid scientific foundation:",
    "principles": [
      "Neuroplasticity: Repetitive writing rewires neural pathways, making positive thinking habitual",
      "Positive Psychology: Positive affirmations enhance self-efficacy and motivation for action",
      "Mindfulness Meditation: Focused practice reduces anxiety and enhances intention clarity",
