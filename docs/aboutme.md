Our Story
Why we created Manifest 369 to go

Personal Journey
I'm 38 years old, and for most of my life, I've had a habit of self-blame that started in my childhood. Every mistake, every setback, I would automatically turn inward with harsh criticism. This mindset held me back in countless ways and created patterns of negative thinking that were difficult to break.

The Turning Point
Three years ago, I reached a breaking point. I knew I needed to change my mindset fundamentally if I was ever going to achieve the life I wanted. I began researching mindset shifts and discovered manifestation techniques. At first, I was skeptical – the idea that changing your thoughts could change your reality seemed too simple. But I was desperate for change, so I decided to try.

The problem was that there wasn't much practical, easy-to-follow guidance available. Most resources were either too vague or overly complicated. I found myself piecing together information from various sources, trying different methods through trial and error.

Creating HeyManifestation.com
This frustration became my inspiration. I realized I couldn't be the only person struggling to find practical manifestation resources. So I decided to create HeyManifestation.com – a platform dedicated to making manifestation techniques accessible, practical, and backed by both ancient wisdom and modern science.

I spent months studying various manifestation methods, testing them personally, and simplifying them into step-by-step processes that anyone could follow. My goal was to create a resource I wish I had when I started my journey – something that removed the confusion and provided clear guidance.

The 369 Method and Beyond
As I explored different manifestation techniques, I discovered the power of the 369 method – inspired by Nikola Tesla's belief in the special properties of these numbers. The structured approach of writing affirmations 3 times in the morning, 6 times in the afternoon, and 9 times at night created a powerful rhythm that seemed to amplify intentions.

But I also discovered a problem: there weren't any good tools to support this practice. Consistency is key in manifestation work, but it's easy to forget, especially when you're just starting. I found myself setting alarms, using calendar reminders, and creating makeshift tracking systems. It was cumbersome and inefficient.

Building a Series of Manifestation Tools
That's when I had the idea to create a series of manifestation tools – apps designed specifically to support different manifestation techniques. Each app would focus on one method, making it simple to practice consistently and track progress.

"Manifest 369 to go" is the first in this series of planned apps. It provides everything needed to practice the 369 method effectively – reminders, affirmation creation guidance, progress tracking, and a supportive community of like-minded practitioners.

In the future, we'll be releasing more apps in this series, including "Manifestation Pillow to go" and "Manifestation Two Cups to go" – each focused on different manifestation techniques that have shown promising results.

Our Mission
My personal transformation through manifestation practices has been profound. The self-blame that once dominated my thoughts has largely dissolved, replaced by self-compassion and a positive outlook. This change wasn't overnight – it took consistent practice and the right techniques. But the results have been life-changing.

Our mission is to help others experience this same transformation. We believe everyone deserves access to tools that can help them shift their mindset, overcome limiting beliefs, and create the life they truly desire. By making manifestation practices accessible, structured, and enjoyable, we hope to empower people worldwide to transform their realities.

Whether you're new to manifestation or have been practicing for years, we invite you to join us on this journey. Try our 369 Method app, share your experiences, and be part of our growing community. Together, we can create a world where everyone has the tools to transform their mindset and manifest their dreams.

With gratitude,
