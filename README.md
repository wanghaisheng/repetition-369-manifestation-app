Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm incredibly excited to share 369 Manifestation with you all!

🧵 The Story:
After discovering the 369 method (write desires 3x morning, 6x afternoon, 9x night), I was amazed by its simplicity and effectiveness. But tracking sessions across different times was frustrating with existing tools.

So I built the dedicated solution I wished existed.

💫 What makes it special:
• **Mindful Interface**: Distraction-free writing environment designed for focus
• **Smart Timing**: Learns your schedule and reminds you at optimal moments  
• **Offline First**: Your manifestations work anywhere, anytime
• **Privacy Focused**: Your dreams stay completely private
• **Habit Building**: Streaks, achievements, and progress visualization

📊 100 Days of Building in Public:
• 1,200+ beta users
• 15,000+ manifestation sessions logged
• 4.9/5 user satisfaction rating
• 89% weekly retention rate

🎯 Real Impact:
"Got my dream job after 21 days of using 369 Manifestation. The consistency tracking kept me motivated!" - Sarah K.

"Finally, an app that makes manifestation feel scientific, not woo-woo." - Mike R.
